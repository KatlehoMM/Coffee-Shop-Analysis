## Project Overview                                                                                                                                                         
This project analyzes the trends of the Bright Coffee Shop, the sales trends that occur during a period of six months, during this time period, month-to-month, day-to-day and week-to-week revenue is being compared, and also the revenue generated by product categories and store locations.
## Recommendations
### Optimize store performance by location
* Focus on improving sales in Lower Manhattan during peak hours to match the performance of Hell's Kitchen and Astoria
* Create target strategies for Astoria to maximise afternoon and evening sales, given its strong performance during these times
### Boost sales of underperforming products
* Evaulate and potentially phase out low-performing products categories (branded items, loose tea, packaged chocolate) or introduce promotions to increse their sales.
* Capitilize on high-demand categories like coffee and tea by expanding offerings or improving marketings eforts
### Increase revenue during low performing periods
* Implement strategies such as discounts or special promotions during evenings and on saturdays to attract more customers
* Explore ways to drive nighttime sales, which contribute the least revenue (0,39%).
